This web page is primarily my own creation. However, I stand on the shoulders of
giants and would give credit to a few of them.

- The fonts used on this site are Sansumi for page headers, Bitter for prose and
article headers, and Anonymous Pro for code.

- [Pygments][] (via [pygments.rb][]) is used for code highlighting along with
the Monokai color scheme realized in CSS by Pygments.

- The background pattern for this page was found on <http://subtlepatterns.com>
and is called [3px tile by Gre3g](http://subtlepatterns.com/3px-tile/)

- The [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) is the language which stitches up my
haphazard writings into a coherent whole. Thanks to the Ruby core team!

- Part of the impetus for writing my own static site generator was my preference
for [mustache](http://mustache.github.com/) over the liquid template language
used by Jekyll and Octopress. Many thanks to [Chris Wanstrath][defunkt] for it!

- I use [normalize.css](http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/) to start from
a single base point with the styles on this site. Thanks Nicolas Gallagher and
Jonathan Neal.

- Nuclearsandwich purple is `#47092E` and is a lovely plum color. I stumbled
upon it hitting random a lot in some forgotten color generator. I like it.

- There's a lovely little gem called [rerun][] by [Alex Chaffee][alexch] that I
use to watch and rebuild the site in development. It's awesome.

It felt like time to redo nuclearsandwich.com... so I did.

If you don't know who I am, fix that [here](/about.html).

Perhaps you are interested in my [blog
article](/blog/2012-09-03-yet-another-blergh-engine.html) about publishing this
very site.
Or [this one](/blog/2012-09-05-inventing-for-clear-understanding.html) about
writing your own tools so you understand the best ones better.

Maybe you just want to see my
[code](https://github.com/nuclearsandwich).

Either way, this is me. Expect whatever.

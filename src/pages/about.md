What I tell other people about me
---------------------------------

During the school year, Steven! is a student of computer science, mathematics,
and latte art, and this past summer he interned at GitHub. Year-round he's a
passionate Ruby hacker who loves contributing to open source projects like
Faraday, Rubinius and Archlinux. He teaches and contributes to KidsRuby,
CoderDojo, and Rails Girls and is also on the core team for RailsBridge. He has
spent more than a few evenings scrabbling to get out of the Bronze League in
StarCraft II. Most importantly, Steven! is a dedicated engineer with a passion
for creating beautiful things.

What I think about me
---------------------

I don't know what I'm doing, but I feel like I do when I teach other people what
little I know. So I do that as much as I possibly can.
